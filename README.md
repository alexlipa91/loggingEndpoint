# Reporting user activity on web application

Endpoint REST listening on "host_name":"host_port"/report/store for POST requests  
It contains a basic class structure to keep track of REST api calls by users of the website  
I had to develop this code for a little module to include in a project at work and I used as a sample for experimenting different frameworks such as JEE and Apache Camel  
  
Next step would be creating an Endpoint version using the Elastic Stack (LogStash, ES and Kibana)
